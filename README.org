* CL-Factoring

This library presents a set of algorithms for computing integer factorizations.
An interface is provided that takes an integer and will return a list of prime
numbers such that, when multiplied together, will result in the original number.

There is no magic sauce here or mathematical breakthroughs; the time
complexities of each algorithm is exponential.

** Interface

The library provides the function =factor=.

Specific factoring methods can be accessed from the package
=cl-factoring-algorithms=.

** General Purpose Factoring Algorithms

 1. Trial Division
 2. Pollard's Rho
 3. Brent's Cycle
 4. Hypercubic Polynomial Quadratic Sieve

** License

This library is licensed under the LLGPL where possible.

Certain algorithms may be developed by others and be licensed under more
permissive licenses.  If development is performed on these, the license will
remain as is (the LLGPL won't infect them).
